## Releasing
To release a new version you'll need to make sure all changes commits are done and pushed. After that you'll need to decide which release type you want to use. The release types are; patch (0.0.1), minor (0.1.0), or major (1.0.0).
```
npm version <release_type>
```
This will update the version number in the `package.json`, and will add a git tag automatically. Next you'll need to push the git tag to the remote.
```
git push --tags origin main
```
After that you'll need to publish to npm.
```
npm publish
```

When you're confident with the release, make sure the version tag is also released at GitHub.
